<h1>Scholtz's House</h1>

<h2>Detachment and belonging</h2> 

Egbert Scholtz was born on October 27th 1942 in the Sudeten German village of WÃ¼nschendorf. Four years after his birth, he and his family were forced to leave their home; a grand house with stables and farmland, to start new lives in post-war Eastern Germany. Today, he lives close to the train station at which they arrived into Germany, in 1946.

Mr Scholtz is one of a group of former residents, who refer to themselves as â€˜WÃ¼nschendorfersâ€™ . A group who have visited the site of WÃ¼nschendorf annually since 2009. 

In Autumn 2013 myself, a translator, and a sound recordist travelled to Northern Germany to visit Mr Scholtz at home. The interview will be filmed so after the lighting is set up and everyone has settled, Mr Scholtz begins to talk.

He explains that the first time he went back to the village was with his parents in 1955-56, a trip made possible through one of his aunts who was able to stay in the village after 1946. At that time travel within the Eastern Block was possible, but not without the relevant paperwork. I presume having a relative to visit made the paperwork easier to obtain.

At this time Mr Scholtz was around fourteen years old and describes that he had none of his own memories of the village, only the ones inherited from his parents. I can imagine the family trundling along in a Trabant during the mid 1950â€™s to see the home they were forced to leave ten years before, for the very first time. I ask the translator to ask him if he can remember how he felt on that trip, he answers:

I was actually curious. I only knew about my parentsâ€™ farm through stories so I was curious to see what it was like in reality. The house on the hill, the surroundings, the view over the entire village. I saw it there,  just the way it was described to me.

Itâ€™s important to add that in 1955-56 many of the houses from the village had been destroyed or officially re-populated by new owners.Mr Scholtzâ€™s house was re-populated. There are several stories from people who returned to the village during these years who say that the village, asides from being renamed was almost unrecognisable. I ask him to tell me more about that first trip back with his parents.

He describes the house as being in exactly the same state as when they left it and continues:

It was fascinating for me that the new owner, or the one who lived in the house at that time, still lived there with the things that my parents had left behind.
When the population of Wunschendorf left the village in around 1946 there was an official baggage restriction of 50kg per person. Many people packed practical possessions, food, clothes, shoes meaning most of their possessions were left behind. Some people had weeks to prepare however others were given just a few hours notice of their departure. When I was living in the village I heard stories about new owners moving in to find a rotting meals inside the oven.

Mr Scholtz continues

There was one little episode on the trip. My mother wanted to have the picture that was hanging in the bedroom above her bed. Without objection we could take it â€“ it wasnâ€™t a valuable picture. But for her it was a memory. Later it hung above my parentsâ€™ bed here, in Germany. That left an impression on me. One could see how deeply affected my parents were when they saw the property, which once used to be theirs.

Some sixty five years later, in 2008,  it was still possible to walk around the family home he is describing. It was falling to ruins but there were still a few interesting documents buried under the hubris, all belonging to the family of the man who opened the door to Egbertâ€™s parents in 1955.

One notable thing about Mr Scholtzâ€™s interview is how calmly and matter of factly he recounts these memories, which at least in my mind, but have been quite traumatic. Itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve observed in many people from his age group who were exiled from the village, perhaps because they were so young at the time of exile.

I ask the translator to ask him more about his connection to the village, and how this compares to his parentsâ€™.

Mr Scholtz answers that for him, returning to the village is an act of remembrance, one to both the village he grew up in and also to his parents. Itâ€™s also a means of connecting to others who experienced the same exile in 1946.

In reference to the village, he says, It leaves its mark on you.

And your grandchildren, the translator asks, do you think they have a connection to the village?

They know about the village through stories but there is no direct attachment to it. Of course, they are curious to see  where their grandmother and grandfather, or great-grandfather and great-grandmother, lived. But one can notice that their home is somewhere else.
